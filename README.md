## Overview
It's like Emerald Rogue, hopefully\
Basically, this is a Pokemon Roguelike where you can fight trainers and catch pokemon\
If you've ever realized it, Pokemon without fetch quests is basically a boss rush, which is what this game intends to be\
You can interact with encounter areas as many times as youd like to try and build a good team\
Who knows, maybe there are even special areas with stronger pokemon\
Keep in mind that you will find stronger pokemon as you make your way up the ladder of gym leaders\
You can also fight enemy trainers that reward you much more exp than wild pokemon\
There are stations to give you items and heal your pokemon, even those that may have fainted\
Take your shot to try and be the very best, like no one ever was
