## Overview
It's like Emerald Rogue, sort of\
Basically, this is a Pokemon Roguelike where you can fight trainers and catch pokemon\
If you've ever realized it, Pokemon without fetch quests is basically a boss rush, which is what this game intends to be\
You can interact with encounter areas 10 times to try and build a good team before the gym battle\
Who knows, maybe you'll find yourself standing in front of a stronger pokemon\
Keep in mind that you will find even stronger pokemon as you make your way up the ladder of gym leaders\
You can also fight 5 enemy trainers leading up to each gym leader\
After each battle, you may press H to heal your team to full\
Face against 8 gym leaders, the elite 4, and then the champion\
Take your shot to try and be the very best, like no one ever was\
Fun Fact: We did not implement everything in the game. Please be mindful of this when considering\
what moves/mechanics we did/didn't implement and plan accordingly
